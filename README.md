# MadCat-Content-Thief---Coin-Counter

This game was created as part of a project for the YogsCast game Jam event in 2019, myself, along with 2 others designed and created MadCat content thief. The game jam lasted 2 days, so there was time pressure, but we still produced a fun, light-hearted game.

The game we produced can be found here : My username at the time was KillerKing86
